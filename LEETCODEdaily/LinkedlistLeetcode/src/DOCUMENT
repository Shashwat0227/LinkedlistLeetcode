   public void insertFirst(int val){
        Node node = new Node (val);
        node.next = head;
        node.prev = null;
        if (head!=null){
            head.prev=node;

Here we made a node class in which we defined a new node named prevv for accessing the previous data and then using constructors we
created the values and other stuff and then we wrote the program for inserting the first element
in this we basically make one node and insert value in that then we point node.next=head ad then node.prev = null and then if head ==null then it
simply is the first element so if head != null then we apply head.prev = node for linking it behind head and then moving head to node
