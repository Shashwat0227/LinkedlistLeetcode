public class deleteanyindex {
 public int Delete (int index ){
         if(index==0){
             return DeleteFirst();

         }
     if(index == size-1){
         return DeleteLast();

     }
     Node prev = get(index -1);
     int val = prev.next.value;
     prev.next = prev.next.next;
     return val;
     }
}
Here we go behind the index which we want to delete so basically what we do is we go back and then the value we move the head to prev.next.next
then by this we delete the term in btw that :)
