Here we made a class for Node which will point to the reference of the elements which are present
cuz we cannot do tail.prev or something like this , so basically we have to put tail to the second last and them tail.next to null
so created a class of Mode for getting size-2 (secondlast term ) and then putted it to tail and then did the process
