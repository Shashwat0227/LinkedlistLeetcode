public class findingNodeusingcval {
 public Node find(int value){
        Node node = head;
    while (node !=null){

return node ;

    return null;
     }
}
here we will make one Node in which we will assign it int index , then we will search for the value by passing through all the node
and then if we find that value we will simply return that node else we will return null
as simple as that .
